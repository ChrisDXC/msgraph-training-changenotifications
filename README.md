# Microsoft Graph Training Module - Using Change Notifications and Track Changes with Microsoft Graph

This module will introduce you to working with change notifications (webhooks) & track changes (delta query) in the Microsoft Graph.

## Lab - Change Notifications and Track Changes with the Microsoft Graph

In this lab you will create a .NET Core console application that receives change notifications from the Microsoft Graph when an update is made to a users account in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The application will managed the Change Notification subscription and use Track Changes in the Microsoft Graph to ensure no changes are missed.
